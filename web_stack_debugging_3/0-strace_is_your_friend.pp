# Puppet manifest to fix the Apache 500 error

# The most common WordPress 500 errors are often due to:
# 1. PHP misconfigurations (file permissions, paths, etc.)
# 2. Typos in PHP file names causing "file not found" errors
# 3. Incorrect file paths in WordPress configuration

# Based on strace output, the issue is likely a misspelled PHP file extension
# in the WordPress configuration (e.g., '.phpp' instead of '.php')

exec { 'fix-wordpress':
  command => 'sed -i s/phpp/php/g /var/www/html/wp-settings.php',
  path    => '/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin',
  onlyif  => 'grep -q phpp /var/www/html/wp-settings.php',
}}
